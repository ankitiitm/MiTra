# MiTra Data 

This repository contains Python scripts for processing and visualizing MiTra traffic trajectory data. 

### Data download:
MiTra data can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.25532/OPARA-706

### Working with the data
The analysis includes calculating distances traveled by vehicles, identifying the vehicle with the maximum distance traveled, and fitting a linear regression model to estimate the trajectory angle.
